Analysis 

The School Board is concerned about evidence of academic dishonesty in the Reading and Math grades of Thomas High School ninth grade students. In an effort to uphold and maintain state-testing standards they have requested an analysis to address the problem. To curtail the impact of this possible academic dishonesty they have decided to equate the grades in question to ‘Nan’, this is the equivalence of saying the math and reading grades of Thomas High School ninth graders is equal to a null value. 

Due to above mentioned changes The School Board would like to determine how equating the grades of these students to a null value will impact, affect or create changes in performance, specifically comparatively to other districts and schools’ based on other variables that were previously assessed results when the results had no null values.  The following analysis will seek to address the queries of The School Board.
